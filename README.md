# Arduino Aqueous Sensor Node
In 2015 an aqueous sensor platform was created to collect data. It collects data, transmits it to other nodes in the system, checks power, and performs basic setup proceedures (adhoc).

As of 3/27/18 it is out of date, but should still work fine. I will look around for the current code and update it later.
